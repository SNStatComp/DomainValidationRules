  description: |
    The indicators, the periodicity and the last observation 
    period of at least one time series must be the same as in 
    the identification in the EDAMIS flow.

    No missing observations (gaps) are accepted in time series, 
    sent in one or several files â€“ i.e. files should be sent in 
    the chronological order based on the latest observation.

  description: |
    Transmission of one time series in different presentations (gross, 
    calendar and seasonally adjusted) should be in one file. Here,

    cases.

  description: | 
    The average index value of the base year (reference year)
    should be 100 for the unadjusted series, for the
    calendar adjusted series and for the calendar and seasonally 
    adjusted series, except when the difference
    from 100 is duly justified in national reference metadata.
